## Fungible
This mod, with help of some mixin hacks, speeds up game and world loading
times by selectively bricking parts of the game. Do not use outside the
development environment - it will cause world corruption when upgrading 
save data. With this mod it takes about 8s to launch the game and load into
a world, compared to the average 19s to do the same on vanilla. It also silences 
the annoying auth exception that takes focus away from the game log in IDEA.
